    //EXERCISE:___________________________________
    
    //1:
    //what happens if you enter more than two words?
    //try to solve this in two ways:
    // - only accept the first two words of any command.
    // - only accept the first and last words of any command.
    
    
    //2:
    //make an array of strings that will get recognized by the parser, like "LOOK", "GO", "GET", etc.
    //loop through the array to see if the command is recognized, then use a switch to display a custom response.
    
    
    //if you're comfortable with the above, try...
    //3: (ADVANCED)
    //if you're feeling brave, try to put this all into a function that will return an array of strings.
    //this is actually a trick question. but spend some time looking into why.
    //if you can't do it, psuedocode it, or try it in another language. look at how "split" works in processing for example.
